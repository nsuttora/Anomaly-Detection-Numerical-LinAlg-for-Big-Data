    "# Anomaly Detection For Images\n",
    "#### In general, anomaly detection algorithms are trained on one type of data (Ex: images of cars), such that the model can accurately recognize that type of data (Ex: new car images) and recognize any other type of data as an anomaly (Ex: an image of a tree). In this case, the instances of anomalous data are near infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifically for this application, anomaly detection algorithms have been trained on MRI scans of normal brains. From this, these algorithms can recognize normal brain scans and we can see how well the models perform at recognizing anomalous data, in this case MRI scans of tumorous brains.\n",
